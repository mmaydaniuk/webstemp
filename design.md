Game Description

The universe is made up of a 1 million x 1.6 million coordinate grid.   There are a configurable number of star systems
likely around 1 to 10 thousand will be normal.

The goal of the game is to eliminate all other players.

The game engine runs in the background continuously; there are no turns.   

BASIC GAME PLAY

Each player has a home world.

Players produce a certain amount of cash (credits? buckazoids?) each turn based on the number of planets they control.   Players
can spend their earned cash on military supplies (ships, fighters or armies).

Armies and fighters can be assigned to ships, which in turn can be assigned to a fleet.   A fleet can be given orders to
either stay and defend a location, or move to a new star system.   When a fleet is sent, it will arrive at the destination
in a certain amount of real-world time.   This might be a couple of minutes for a close star system, or several hours
for a trip across the game universe.

BATTLES

When a fleet arrives at a planet, the planet may be owned by a native population, or another empire, or may be totally 
uninhabited.

Assuming someone is there already, a battle will ensue.     Ships and fighters perform space and air combat.
Armies are required for ground combat.   At least one army must be on the ground to control the planet. 

OTHER FEATURES

Game Lobby - allows player to log in and choose one of several games to play

FUTURE IDEAS

Trade engine - build a basic economy of raw and manufactured materials.   Create non-player characters that transport
goods from star system to star system.   This will add the complexity that an enemy empire may also be a key trading partner.

Planetary Improvements - by investing in your planets, you can get more productivity and wealth from them

Asset transfers - allow players to transfer credits and materials between themselves.

Commodities Market - allow trading in commodities.   Players could focus on making money instead of war.

Technological Advances - allow empires to improve technologically like Civ.
